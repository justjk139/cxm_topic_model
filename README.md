### IPPS - CXM Topic Model Project
This project is focused on organizing the ServiceNow case tickets received by the Customer Experience Management (CXM) Team at IPPS. The CXM team was looking for a way to better organize case tickets and had asked the Analytics team for help. The main objective was to demonstrate a possible way to categorize the tickets into topics that could be used to enhance the teams ability to quickly resolve issues and prevent a backlog of cases. Topic modeling was the method of choice and was done using Gensim from an online tutorial approved by all members of the Analytics team. Certain actions and changes were made as needed to work with our specific datasets and as a results of requests from the CXM Team. This current iteration is not intended to be the final solution.

** Datasets SHOULD NOT be pushed to repository per team policy **
